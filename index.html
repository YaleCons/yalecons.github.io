	<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Conservative Party</span>
	, the nation's foremost collegiate philosophical debating society, stands alone among Yale institutions. It is a haven for those who believe that ideas have consequences, and that the best of what has been thought and said by man deserves rigorous exploration.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">
	<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The members of the Conservative Party</span>
	are not united by a single strand of the conventional political spectrum, but by a devotion to the production of principled and profound leaders.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">
	<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Toward the formation of such individuals</span>
	, the Party and its members hold a devotion to the critical inquiry and loyalty to Truth which so characterize our Western inheritance. In this spirit, the Party holds events which investigate every facet of politics, philosophy, and religion. These events culminate in the weekly Debate Caucus, which is structured in a traditional parliamentary format derived from the British House of Lords so that individuals grow by advancing their own ideas against those of others.
